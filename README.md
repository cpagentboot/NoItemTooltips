# **No Item Tooltips**

> *“Are you sick of Minecraft treating you like a newborn baby, gently whispering helpful hints and item descriptions in your ears every time your mouse dares hover over something? Do you crave mystery, confusion, and the pure, unfiltered chaos of not knowing what the hell you’re holding? Then boy, do I have the mod for you!”*

## Features

- **No More Tooltips**  
  Pictures remain. But the words? Gone. What does this red bottle do? Could be healing. Could be poison. Could be liquid despair. Take a sip and find out. Figure it out yourself, coward.

- **Embrace the Chaos**  
  Who needs clarity? Reading is for nerds. You play Minecraft, not bookcraft. Who cares what enchantments that pickaxe has? SHINY IS SHINY!

- **Minimalism Level 9000**  
  I didn’t just hide the tooltips; we destroyed them. There’s nothing left. Nada. Zilch. Just like my hopes and dreams.

- **Ultimate Hardcore Mode**  
  Try surviving when your gear has mystery enchantments. That’s not a Sharpness V sword. That’s a Butter Knife of Unknown Sorcery™.

- **Pretentious Appeal**  
  Make your friends think you’ve ascended beyond mere mortal UI conveniences.  
  *"Oh, you still read tooltips? How quaint."*
